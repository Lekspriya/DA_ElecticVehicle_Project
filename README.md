# DA_ElecticVehicle_Project
This is my mini project for the Data Analytics course with Entri. I am currently working on an Electric Vehicles (EV) dataset and have started cleaning and preparing the data using Excel. The steps and transformations I performed will be documented in the README file, do check it out..

## Data Cleaning & Preparation

* Imported the dataset in **.csv format into Excel**.
* Removed duplicate records to ensure data accuracy.
* Verified and corrected **data types** for each column.
* Handled inconsistencies by filling **null values** in *Autonomous_Level*, *CO2_Emissions_g_per_km*, and *Safety_Rating* using the **average value of each respective column**
* Created a new **Sales Revenue** column calculated from *Units Sold* and *Price* to support further analysis and visualization.
