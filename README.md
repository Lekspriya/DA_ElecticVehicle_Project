# DA_ElecticVehicle_Project
This is my mini project for the Data Analytics course with Entri. I am currently working on an Electric Vehicles (EV) dataset and have started cleaning and preparing the data using Excel. The steps and transformations I performed will be documented in the README file, do check it out..

## Data Cleaning & Preparation

* Imported the dataset in **.csv format into Excel**.
* Removed duplicate records to ensure data accuracy.
* Verified and corrected **data types** for each column.
* Handled inconsistencies by filling **null values** in *Autonomous_Level*, *CO2_Emissions_g_per_km*, and *Safety_Rating* using the **average value of each respective column**
* Created a new **Sales Revenue** column calculated from *Units Sold* and *Price* to support further analysis and visualization.

## **Data Visualization**
After cleaning the dataset, the data was imported into Power BI for visualization and reporting.
Six important measures were created to analyze the data:
* Total Revenue
* Total Units Sold
* Average Price
* Average Range
* Target Units
* Revenue Total
  
These measures were used to create **KPI cards, charts, and interactive reports.**
An additional calculated column called **Price Band** was created to categorize vehicles into different price segments (Budget, Mid, Premium) for better analysis.
The dashboard was designed with different analytical views:
**Marketing-based analysis –** sales performance, market share, and country-wise distribution
**Technical-based analysis**– battery capacity, range, charging type, and safety insights
**Price-based analysis**– revenue contribution and pricing strategy
**Warranty-based analysis** – warranty comparison across manufacturers and years
The final result is an interactive dashboard that provides clear insights into EV sales, performance, and market trends.
